A command-line blackjack game
Originally developed in the fall of 2014 for cois-2020h, Data Structures and Algorithms.

usage:
- Accepts unlimited players
- every player starts with 10 winnings
- clear, descriptive prompts tell the user what to type at each step

development:
- (written in 2017) I seem to remember there being a bug with calculating winnings.  I am going to try to track that down, just for the sake of besting an old foe.
